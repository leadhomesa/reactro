<hr />

# Getting Started
```
cp sample.env .env
npm install
```

## Config
Sample config can be found in `sample.env`.
At the moment the following values are supported:
- **PORT**: The port the webpack dev server runs on.
- **NODE_ENV**: Changing this value to `production` enables a service worker.
- **API_URL**: Api Url which is proxied by the Webpack dev server (and nginx if you use the Docker image).
- **PUBLIC_URL**: This value is only necessary to be included when you need to host the build output on a subdirectory. For example `https://yourwebsite.com/carbon`

# Local development with HMR
```
npm start
```

# Production build
- Set NODE_ENV=production to enable the service worker.
```
npm run build
OR
npm run clean-and-build
```
